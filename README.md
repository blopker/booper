# Booper
Booper is essentially a much smaller and simplified version of the r/place reddit page.
The basic idea is that when users open the site, they will see a 4x4 grid of buttons. These buttons will either be on or off (red or green), and this grid will be the exact same for every user. If one user clicks on the top left button on their screen and turns it red, then the top left button on the screens of every other user will also be made red within about 3 seconds. The current button state will also be visible immediately to all new viewers and to viewers who refresh the page.
